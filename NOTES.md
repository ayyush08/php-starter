- Htdocs folder stores all files of php programs that we write


## Why PHP?

- PHP is a server-side scripting language
- Using PHP, we can interact with databases, create dynamic web pages, and do many more things

- Instead of lots of commands to output HTML, PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something".

## Syntax

- A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`
- `<?php` is the opening tag and `?>` is the closing tag
- PHP statements end with a semicolon (;) // This is a must

### Comments in PHP

- Single line comments start with `//`
- Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`
