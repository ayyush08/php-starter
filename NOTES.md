- Htdocs folder stores all files of php programs that we write


## Why PHP?

- Stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor

- PHP is a server-side scripting language
- Using PHP, we can interact with databases, create dynamic web pages, and do many more things

- Instead of lots of commands to output HTML, PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something".

## Syntax

- A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`
- `<?php` is the opening tag and `?>` is the closing tag
- PHP statements end with a semicolon (;) // This is a must

### Comments in PHP

- Single line comments start with `//`
- Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`


Note: Keywords, classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

## Variables

- Variables are case-sensitive
- Variables start with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable
- They are containers for storing data values.

- No concept of data types for variables in PHP because PHP is a loosely typed language, which means that variables do not need to be declared with any particular data type.
