- Htdocs folder stores all files of php programs that we write


## Why PHP?

- PHP is a server-side scripting language
- Using PHP, we can interact with databases, create dynamic web pages, and do many more things

- Instead of lots of commands to output HTML, PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something".
